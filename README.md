### Test your memory and see if you can find all the pairs of 90's nostalgia before the timer runs out!


**Technologies Used**

This game was created using HTML/ CSS / Javascript and my love for memorabilia from my childhood. 




**Getting Started**

Click and Play --> (https://www.aclap.github.io/memory)
When the game starts all 20 cards will be face down, you can click on two at a time and if they are a match, they will stay face up. If they do not match, they will flip back. The object of the game is to find all the matches as soon as possible.
You have 60 seconds to find 10 pairs. Have fun!



**Next Steps**

Ideas I currently have in the ice box are to add difficulty levels of how many cards/how long you have, and also different themes of cards for the player to choose from.
